## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, my name is Ellie and I am a 1st year software engineering degree apprentice. 

I have some prior experience with PHP and SQL out of personal interest, however am super excited to start learning key fundamentals in Python and Java. Specifically, I am looking to develop my coding skills in relevance to Market Data to support my apprenticeship. Over the next 4 years, I am looking forward to developing a range of skills that will support my final project at the end of my degree!
